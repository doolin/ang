      <p>This section builds on the <i>isolate</i> scope section covered previously.
      The notion is that having an isolate scope is rendered much more useful when
      able to bind data from outside the directive scope to within the isolate scope.

      <p>This is accomplished by passing one of the following three alaises in the object:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> @ or @attr: <b>Local Scope Property</b> binds a local scope (string) to the value
          of the DOME attribute: the outer scope will be available inside the directive scope.</li>
        <li> = or =attr: <b>Bi-directional binding</b> the local property reflects change in the 
          parent property.</li>
        <li> & or &attr: <b>Parent execution binding</b> point to a function wrapper passed in
          where the key is the name on the argument and the value being the argument to pass.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I don't understand how to implement this in practice yet, but I get the just of how
        componetry can be built. There are many pages following this with much more exposition
        and no examples. I'll have to take notes instead of implementing for now.</p>
